#+TITLE: RFC 7030 Implementation Notes

* Implementation decisions

** Trust Anchor (TA) Database
~estoperator~ implements the Explicit TA Database on each issuer resource.  The Implicit TA Database is not implemented.

This decision simplifies the controller.  The Implicit TA Database requires the Explicit TA Database, and triggers requirements for manual intervention to validate trust decisions.  If manual intervention is required, it's simpler to validate the trust anchor "out of band" and update the issuer resource.

** Server Authorization
Servers are authorized /only/ through RFC 6125 methods.  ~id-kp-cmcRA~ extension validation is not implemented.

This decision simplifies trust validation for HTTPS sessions, and ensures that HTTP Basic Authentication secrets are not unintentially leaked as required by other RFC 7030 requirements.

** CA Distribution
CA distribution and bootstrapping is not implemented.  The Explicit TA Database is manually updated with "out of band" procedures.  Bootstrapping and automated trust anchor updates add requirements that imply a command line interface.  Limited support for the ~/cacerts~ endpoint is implemented in order to validate that the TA is correct for each issuer, and mark issuers as not ready if the trust anchor is changes.

This decision simplifies the controller and eliminates interactive client requirements.  Trust anchor updates are planned well in advance, and the tempo of certificate reissuance is such that short interruptions do not lead to service outages.  Validation that the current Explicit TA Database is current is implemented to provide notification that a TA has changed.  Revalidation of the issuer ~cacert~ occurs every ~DEFAULT_INTERVAL~ seconds (defaults to 1 week).
